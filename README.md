This study adopts the same dataset as previous studies [1], [2], which focused on identifying the structure of the perovskite compound ABO3. This dataset consists of 397 compounds, of which 254 are perovskites (labeled 1) and 143 are non-perovskites (labeled 0). The dataset has 10 attributes, with nine attributes as input features and one attribute as a target (label). The nine features are tolerance factor (t), octahedral factor 𝑟𝐵/𝑟𝑂, a ratio of A to O atoms radius (𝑟𝐴/𝑟𝑂), the bond length of A-O (𝑑𝐴𝑂) and B-O
(𝑑𝐵𝑂), electronegativity difference for A-O (B-O) multiplied by the ratio of A (B) to O radius (Δ𝜒𝐴𝑂.𝑟𝐴/𝑟𝑂), (Δ𝜒𝐴𝑂.𝑟𝐵/𝑟𝑂), and Mendeleev numbers for A (ℳ𝐴) and(ℳ𝐵 ) atoms.
